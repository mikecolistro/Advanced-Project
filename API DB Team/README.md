Database Team
========

## Getting started
    git clone https://github.com/CS4431/database/
    cd database
    bundle install
    rackup
    
That will start the Sinatra web server and will start intercepting API requests.

## Generating docs
    yard doc

A .yardopts file is already included in the repository, so it will store the documentation created in the right folder
